Creating and designing a presentation, sometimes boring but a very important skill that is important to master.

## Presentation Markdown

Let's start with the base:

- It is important to communicate the results of your research to others
- A scientific presentation --- a researcher's working tool
- It is important to create the presentation quickly
- It is desirable to minimize the effort required to create the presentation

# Relevance

- Makes it clear what the presentation is about
- Should describe the problem broadly and concisely
- Motivate your research
- Formulate goals and objectives
- It is possible to formulate expected results

# Goals and objectives

- Do not formulate more than 1--2 objectives of the study

# Materials and methods

- Present data qualitatively
- Quantitative, only if absolutely necessary
- Excessive detail is unnecessary

# Study content

- Proposed solution to the research problems with justification
- Key milestones

# Results

- Do not need all results
- Need logical connections between slides
- Need to show understanding of the material

# Summary slide

- The last sentence is memorized. Â© Stirlitz
- The main message you want to convey to the audience
- Avoid using a final slide that looks like # Thank you for your attention #

# Recommendations #

# The 10/20/30 principle

  - 10 slides
  - 20 minutes per presentation
  - 30 point font size

# Linking slides
- One slide --- one thought
- You cannot refer to objects on previous slides (e.g., formulas)
- Each slide must have a title

# Number of entities
- A person can remember $7 \pm 2$ of an item at one time
- When placing information on a slide, try to keep the slide to no more than 5 elements in total
- You can group elements so that visually there are no more than 5 groups.

# General recommendations

- Information that is perceived worse without visual support should be put on the slide
- Slides should complement or summarize the content of the presentation or parts of it, not duplicate it.
- The information on the slides should be brief, clear and well-structured
- The slide should not be overloaded with graphics and text
- Do not overuse animations and transitions

# Presentation of data

- It is better to present in the form of a diagram
- Less optimal to present in the form of a figure, graph, table
- Text is used if all previous ways of displaying information have failed
