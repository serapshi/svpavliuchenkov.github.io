## Introduction

In today's world of software development, speed and efficiency are key success factors. This is why more and more companies are adopting Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices into their workflows.

## CI/CD Basis.

CI/CD is a methodology that automates the processes of building, testing, and deploying applications. It helps reduce time to market for new features, improve code quality, and reduce risks associated with manual processes.

## Benefits

- Accelerated development. Automating build, test, and deployment allows you to deploy code changes faster.

- Improved quality. Regular testing at every stage of development helps identify and eliminate bugs early.

- Risk mitigation. Automated deployment processes minimize the chance of human error.

- Improved transparency. CI/CD provides visibility into all stages of development, which helps the team better understand the process and make more informed decisions.

- Improved efficiency. Automating routine tasks frees up developers' time for more creative and valuable work
  
- Improved teamwork. A shared understanding of the development process and clear lines of responsibility foster better team collaboration.

- In general, CI/CD implementation allows companies to speed up development, improve product quality, reduce risks and generally increase the efficiency of the entire software development process.
