I would like to start with the idea that the first programming languages were created for scientific purposes and most of their predecessors inherit this idea. And it all started with simple loops, and became finalized with flights to the moon and space. Today I want to do a little description of the advantages of different languages.

## Scientific programming languages


The language I want to mention first is Fortran, a programming language that was developed in the 1950s by IBM. It was used to create programs for cluster-separated algorithms, as well as for numerically solving equations and mathematical models.
At one time, I also worked in fortran, but I'll note, it's not a pleasant endeavor. While working on [DustEM's](https://www.ias.u-psud.fr/DUSTEM/userguide.html) I realized the advantages of fortran, because it is a language aimed at high-performance computing. The pros of fortran are high performance, simplicity of algorithm description, efficient memory usage, attention to complexity and realizability.

But these days another language dominates - Python is the 3rd most popular language in the world after Java and C++. Python has a very simple development standard, but its main plus is the overwhelming number of libraries with implementations of different kinds of functions, for scientists the most useful are scipy, numpy, pandas, scikit for astrophysicists - astropy. But this is only a couple of thousands of the most useful libraries, but it is impossible to mention the big disadvantage of python, namely its speed. Python has a speed of about 10^6 iterations/minute.

C++ has adopted all the advantages of Fortran'a, but its main advantage is its speed, namely about 10^8 iterations per minute. It is also a language that gets a new standard every 4 years. In each update the language is updated with new built-in features, which is why it is rapidly evolving.
