Now I'm going to tell you how I dedicated this whole week to resting and practicing skateboarding.

## Why it's important not to get discouraged
- Throughout my journey of discovering myself and skateboarding as a whole I have gone through a million obstacles. It's no exaggeration to say that if I had stopped trying or switched to something else because of failures and falls, I wouldn't have reached the level I have. After all, if I stopped doing kickflips, I would also just be back to my past self, or even a worse version of myself. After all, it is not for nothing that they say that Michael Phelps became great not when he won his first medal at the Olympic Games or when he won his 14th! medal, but when he decided to run an extra lap, or when he decided to train for an extra 15 minutes. After all, without all these extra exercises, which at that moment did not give any visible development and usefulness. It was his desire that helped him become great, which is why I've been trying to do the kickflip non-stop all this week. Spoiler - I failed, but I will not despair, I will revise my technique and continue to try and learn from my mistakes.
