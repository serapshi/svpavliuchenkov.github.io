Caught myself thinking this week that I wanted to tighten up my blind typing skill, subsequently, that's all I've been practicing.
## Blind typing
- I believe that the skill of blind typing is a skill that everyone should have. I use this great site [EdClub](https://www.edclub.com/) for development and training. On it you can find a lot of courses with different content for people of all ages. But my choice fell on the classic course of this service - TypingJungle. This week I have been practicing for 22 hours with the exercises of this course, and the only thing I can say is that I am satisfied with everything.
- At the moment my average typing speed is 40 words per minute. I wonder what I will achieve in a year if I can successfully turn this into a hobby!
