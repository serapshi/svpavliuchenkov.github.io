This week turned out to be quite productive. Even though it started out sluggish, by the end of the week I was able to get into a work rhythm (Meanwhile, the weather was too hot this week, which made me procrastinate a bit, but as they say, nobody's perfect).

It's times like these that remind me how important it is to be mindful and constantly work on myself. This week, I really rethought a lot of things, from small actions to time management.

I managed to get a lot of debt done this week, so next week I'll start slowly getting back to my hobbies that I've neglected during this time.
