Report markdown, sometimes boring, but a very important skill that everyone should have.

## Report Markdown

The basic principles of registration of reports on practice are given in the Standard of the organization “The order of registration of methodical developments, course and graduate qualified works”. The order is developed on the basis of the State standards of document design (GOST 1.5-2001, GOST 7.1-2003).

The text of the report on practice should be typed on the computer font Times New Roman size 14 pt. (Microsoft Word text editor shall be used in the design of the text). It is recommended to reduce the font used in the illustrative material (tables and figures) to 12 pt. Line spacing in the main text is one and a half. In the illustrative material, it is recommended to make the line spacing single. Page margins should be:

- left margin - 30 mm;

- right margin - 10 mm;

- upper and lower margins - 20 mm.

Each paragraph should start with a red line. Indentation of the paragraph - 12.5 mm. from the left border of the text.

Each section of the report should start from a new page. The names of the structural elements of the report “CONTENT”, “INTRODUCTION”, “CONCLUSION”, “LITERATURE LIST”, “APPENDIX”, as well as the titles of sections should be printed in capital letters and placed in the middle of the line. Sections are numbered with Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). No period should be placed at the end of the headings.

It is allowed to highlight the headings of sections in bold type. It is not allowed to use underlining in the headings, the use of two or more types of emphasis in the headings (for example, italics and bold, italics and another color different from the main text), transposition of words in the headings of chapters, as well as the use of non-standard symbols in the text of the report, the use of abbreviations in the headings. In the text of the report, abbreviations of terms are allowed only after the introduction of a meaningful definition of the term. All pages of the report (except for the appendices) should be numbered, starting with the “Introduction”, which is numbered 3. Page numbers are located in the center of the lower part of the sheet without a dot.

Illustrative material (tables, figures, formulas) is included in the report in order to visualize the argumentation and justification of the conclusions obtained by the student. Thus, in the main part of the report is placed only that material that contributes to a better substantiation of the conclusions obtained by the student. Tables, reporting forms and other factual material that represents the raw data on the basis of which the study was made, the main text of the work is not included in the main text of the work, but can be placed in the appendix. Tables and figures based on the original factual data are recommended to be included directly in the main text of the report. All illustrative material should, if possible, be placed after the first mention of it in the text.

Illustrations are numbered within sections. The number of the illustration consists of the section number and the serial number of the illustration, separated by a dot. No period is placed at the end. If the table is borrowed from a book or article by another author, it should be referenced at the end of the title, taking into account the requirements of these guidelines. It is not allowed to leave empty cells in the columns of the table. If the corresponding data are missing, a dash is put in the column. The units of measurement should be indicated to the numerical tabular data. If the table data have different units of measurement, they shall be indicated in the appropriate headings of columns or rows of the table. If all tabular data have one and the same unit of measurement, this unit, starting with the preposition “in”, should be given above the table after the name with a comma (for example, in thousand rubles, in ha, in sq. m., in percent, etc.).

If necessary, the table can be moved to another page. In this case, the following design variant is used. Column (or row) headings of the table are numbered, and on the next page the text of the headings is not repeated, but only the corresponding column (row) number. The words “Continuation of Table 1.1” shall be printed above the continuation of the table from the top right. The title of the table is not repeated on the new page. It is not allowed to start the table at the bottom of the page, if after the table title only the header part remains, or the header part plus one or two lines of content, and the main part of the table is on the next sheet. It is not allowed to transfer the table to the next page if one or two lines of table content are transferred to the next page. In this case, it is necessary to either slightly reduce the font size used in the table, so that the table will fit entirely on the previous sheet; or slightly increase the spacing between the rows of the table, so that the table is located on the pages more evenly. Figures include drawings, charts, diagrams, graphs, etc. If the table or figure by volume occupy more than one page, they should be placed in the appendix to the report. Placement of figures in the report is the same as for other illustrative material, i.e. either immediately after the reference to it, or on the page nearest to this reference. Figures should be placed in the text so that they can be viewed without turning the work. All figures should be numbered within the sections in Arabic numerals: Figure 2.1. A meaningful title follows immediately after the figure numbering designation. The figure number and title are placed at the bottom of the figure, centered relative to the figure.

Equations and formulas should be separated from the text on a separate line. In formulas as symbols should be used designations established by the relevant state standards, and reflected in the formula format. 

Literature sources used in the process of writing the report are indicated at the end of the work before the appendix.

In the report it is not recommended to retell the content of textbooks, manuals, regulatory and specialized literature. This information should be revised and presented in the content of the work. Direct borrowing from sources without reference to the author or normative document is inadmissible. When using numerical data, provisions from official documents, quotations and other published materials, the student must indicate the source and make a reference in square brackets. Example: [12, p. 34], which means: 12 is the number of the source in the reference list, 34 is the page number. The appendix contains materials that supplement the text of the report. For example, data used for calculations; intermediate tables and diagrams that influenced the construction of the final tables and figures; intermediate calculations showing the dynamics of the student's evidence; description of algorithms; tables and figures of non-standard format, etc. Appendices are placed in the work after the list of references. Each appendix is consecutively numbered with Arabic numerals. If the appendix is more than one page, it is transferred to another page and labeled at the top as “Continuation of the appendix ...”. All annexes should be referenced in the text of the report. The arrangement of appendices at the end of the document should correspond to the order in which they are referenced in the text. Each annex starts on a new page. The word “ANNEX” and its serial number (e.g., “ANNEX 1”) should appear in the upper right corner of the page. Each appendix should have a title on the next line after the word “APPENDIX” and the title should be centered on the text. If the documents are in large format, they should be folded to A4 size. In this case, one page of such non-standard size shall be numbered as one page of the appendix (without taking into account its folding).
