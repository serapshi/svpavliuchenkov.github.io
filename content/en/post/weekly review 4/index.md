Today I'm going to tell you about a slightly sad week.

## Why it's important not to keep track of time
- This week turned out to be a sad week, due to the large amount of things I've been fortunate enough to accumulate. Overcoming stress is an important topic that deserves a long post, but that's not what today is about. I felt the consequences of my laziness very well, namely, 14 hours of work a day was very stressful, but I am not discouraged, because I realize that after I finish I will be able to rest at least 2 days (it will not be enough).The lesson that I learned this week is that you can not make neglecting responsibilities a habit. So starting this week, I'm going to put it on my weekly self-checklist. Hopefully you'll become a little more disciplined like I am after this.
