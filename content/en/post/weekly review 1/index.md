Welcome 👋

### AFSH reunion
- The highlight this week was the traditional reunion, learned a lot about who and what they are doing now, as well as who and where they have been recently. Life, it must be said, is busy for everyone.
1- There was a traditional First September cake from Dima Andreev's mom. Thank you so much for such deliciousness 🥮👍
2. Angelina Tresokva told us about her startup on development and production of oil pipeline support displacement sensors. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
3. Ira Klopova-Saporovska not only defended her diploma, but also managed to go to Serbia for the summer school on cosmology, which was held by the Petnica Science Station. Ira shared her experience of participation in the English-speaking school and told how important it is for science and personal development to be able to communicate with the international community ✈🌎
4. Stasya Topchieva and Tamara Molyarova, having won a travel grant, visited South Africa for the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union, which was held not so long ago in Cape Town. Of course, they didn't just look at penguins there, but made scientific presentations. 🐧🐧🐧
5. Gleb Pereverzev, Katya Tokareva and Artem Zaporozhets did not tell anything about how they went by car to SAO RAS for the conference. Apparently, they didn't just go to see their native places either. 🚗



#### And a little bit about my bad luck. 
- My doctor and I were interested in one vitamin in my blood, and because of that, a week ago I went and took a blood test at the polyclinic. But when I came to the appointment I found out that the nurse had marked me for other tests, which is very unfortunate, so I had to take blood again today.
